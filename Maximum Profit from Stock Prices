Maximum Profit from Stock Prices
🧠 Problem Overview

You are given a list of stock prices where each element represents the price of a stock on a particular day.
Your task is to calculate the maximum profit you can achieve by making any number of buy and sell transactions, with the condition that:

You must sell the stock before you buy again

You can buy and sell on different days

You cannot hold multiple stocks at the same time

💡 Approach & Intuition

This solution follows a greedy strategy:

Iterate through the list of prices

Whenever today’s price is higher than yesterday’s, take the profit

Accumulate all such positive differences

Why this works:

Any increasing sequence can be broken into smaller profitable trades

The sum of all these small profits equals the maximum possible profit

This avoids complex dynamic programming and keeps the solution efficient and elegant.

Add Binary Strings
📌 Problem Description
Given two binary strings s1 and s2 consisting only of characters '0' and '1', compute their binary sum and return the result as a binary string.
Important Notes
Input strings may contain leading zeros
The output string must not contain leading zeros
The strings can be very large (up to 10⁶ characters), so numeric conversion is not allowed

🧠 Approach

The solution simulates manual binary addition using string traversal:

Start from the rightmost characters of both strings

Add corresponding bits along with a carry

Store the result bit (sum % 2)

Update the carry (sum // 2)

Continue until all bits and carry are processed

Remove leading zeros from the final result

This approach ensures efficiency even for very large inputs.

⚙️ Algorithm

Initialize two pointers at the end of both strings

Use a variable to track carry

Iterate while either pointer is valid or carry exists

Append each computed bit to a result list

Reverse the result and strip leading zeros

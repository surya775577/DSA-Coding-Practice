Maximum Subarray Sum

The Maximum Subarray Sum problem is a fundamental array optimization problem that focuses on identifying a contiguous segment of an array with the highest possible sum.
Given an integer array arr[], the task is to determine the maximum sum obtainable from any non-empty continuous subarray.
A subarray must consist of consecutive elements, and at least one element must be included in the solution.

🔍 Why This Problem Matters

This problem is widely used to:
Teach dynamic programming concepts
Assess problem-solving and optimization skills
Evaluate understanding of time and space complexity
Serve as a foundation for more advanced problems (e.g., circular arrays, 2D arrays)
It frequently appears in technical interviews, competitive programming, and coding assessments.

🧠 Key Insight

At each index, we decide:
Whether to extend the current subarray
Or start a new subarray from the current element
This greedy decision-making process leads to an optimal solution when applied correctly.

⚙️ Approach Used

The problem is efficiently solved using Kadane’s Algorithm, which:
Traverses the array once
Maintains the maximum sum ending at each position
Keeps track of the overall maximum encountered
This ensures optimal performance even for large input sizes.

🚀 Performance Characteristics

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
The solution is highly efficient and suitable for large arrays (up to 10^5 elements).

Odd or Even
📌 Problem Statement

Given a positive integer n, determine whether it is even or odd.
Return:

true → if the number is even

false → if the number is odd

💡 Approach

A number is:

Even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., n % 2 == 0)

Odd if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., n % 2 != 0)

We simply use the modulus (%) operator to check the remainder when divided by 2.

🧪 Examples
Input	Output	Explanation
n = 15	false	15 is not divisible by 2 → Odd
n = 44	true	44 is divisible by 2 → Even

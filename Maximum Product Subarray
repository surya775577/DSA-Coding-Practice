This program finds the maximum product of a contiguous subarray within a given integer array.
The array may contain positive numbers, negative numbers, and zeros, making the problem non-trivial.

A brute-force approach would be inefficient. This solution uses an optimized dynamic programming technique to achieve linear time complexity.

⚙️ Key Idea
At every position in the array:

Track the maximum product ending at that index

Track the minimum product ending at that index

Why track both?

A negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum (and vice versa)

🔁 Algorithm Logic
Initialize:

max_pro, min_pro, and result with the first element

Traverse the array from left to right

If the current element is negative, swap max_pro and min_pro

Update:
max_pro = max(current, max_pro × current)
min_pro = min(current, min_pro × current)
Update the global maximum result

🚀 Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) (constant extra space)

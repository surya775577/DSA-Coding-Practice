Implement Atoi (String to Integer Conversion)
📌 Problem Statement

Given a string s, convert it into a 32-bit signed integer without using any built-in conversion functions.

The conversion follows the rules of the atoi() function.

🧠 Conversion Rules

Ignore leading whitespaces

Determine the sign (+ or -), default is positive

Read digits until a non-digit character is found

If no digits are present, return 0

Clamp the result within the 32-bit signed integer range

INT_MAX = 2³¹ − 1

INT_MIN = −2³¹

✅ Examples
Input	Output
"-123"	-123
" -"	0
" 1231231231311133"	2147483647
"-999999999999"	-2147483648
" -0012gfg4"	-12
🧩 Solution Approach

Traverse the string character by character

Use ASCII values to convert characters to digits

Handle overflow during number construction

Stop processing once a non-digit character is encountered

Minimum Characters to Add for Palindrome
📌 Problem Statement

Given a string s, find the minimum number of characters to add at the front of the string to make it a palindrome.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

🧠 Approach

Instead of checking every prefix (which would take O(n²) time), we use an optimized KMP (Knuth–Morris–Pratt) based approach to solve the problem in O(n) time.

🔍 Key Idea

Reverse the string.

Create a new string:

temp = s + "#" + reverse(s)


Compute the LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array for temp.

The last value of the LPS array gives the length of the longest palindromic prefix.

Final Answer:

len(s) - lps[-1]

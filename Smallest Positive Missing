Smallest Positive Missing Number
📌 Problem Statement

Given an integer array arr[], your task is to find the smallest positive integer that is missing from the array.

A positive number starts from 1

The array may contain negative numbers, zeros, and duplicates

🧠 Key Insight

For an array of size n, the smallest missing positive number must lie in the range [1, n+1].
Any number outside this range can be safely ignored.

The solution rearranges the array in-place so that:

Each value x (where 1 ≤ x ≤ n) is placed at index x-1

After rearrangement, the first index where arr[i] ≠ i+1 gives the answer

🛠️ Approach Used

Cyclic Placement (Index Mapping)

Rearrange elements so that each valid number is placed at its correct index

Scan the array to identify the first missing positive integer

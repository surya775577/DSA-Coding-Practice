Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, find all elements that appear more than ⌊n/3⌋ times.
The result should be returned as a sorted list.

Approach
This solution uses a frequency map (dictionary) to count how many times each element appears in the array.

Steps followed:

Traverse the array and store the frequency of each element.

Compare each frequency with ⌊n/3⌋.

Collect elements that satisfy the condition.

Sort the result before returning it.

This approach is simple, readable, and efficient for large inputs.

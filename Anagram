Anagram Check
📌 Problem Statement

Given two non-empty strings s1 and s2 consisting only of lowercase English letters, determine whether they are anagrams of each other.

Two strings are considered anagrams if they contain the same characters with exactly the same frequencies, regardless of order.

✅ Approach

The solution uses a frequency counting technique:

If the lengths of both strings differ, they cannot be anagrams.

Since only lowercase English letters are involved, a fixed-size array of length 26 is used.

Increment the frequency for characters in s1.

Decrement the frequency for characters in s2.

If all frequency values are zero at the end, the strings are anagrams.

This approach avoids sorting and ensures optimal performance.

⚙️ Algorithm Steps

Compare the lengths of s1 and s2.

Initialize a frequency array of size 26.

Traverse both strings simultaneously:

Increase count for s1 characters.

Decrease count for s2 characters.

Verify that all frequency values are zero.

Return true if they match, otherwise false.

🧠 Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1) (constant space for 26 characters)

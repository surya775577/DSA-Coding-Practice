Search Pattern (KMP Algorithm)
📌 Problem Statement

Given two strings:

txt → Text string

pat → Pattern string

Find and return all starting indices (0-based indexing) where the pattern pat appears in the text txt.

If the pattern does not occur in the text, return an empty list.
Approach

This project implements the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm, an efficient string matching technique.

Why KMP?

Avoids redundant comparisons

Works efficiently for large inputs

Time Complexity: O(n + m)

n → Length of text

m → Length of pattern

🧠 Algorithm Steps

Construct the LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array for the pattern.

Use LPS to skip unnecessary comparisons while scanning the text.

Store all starting indices where full pattern matches occur.
